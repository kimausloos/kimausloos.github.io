30-Something webdev turned ops, 2 kids, a wife and 2 cats

I've been doing *real* computer stuff since I was about 13 years old and started with (Q)BASIC, html, JavaScript and later went on to C, Java and some assembler. In the end the web's attraction was too strong and I started building websites with php. My first Linux install was Slackware in 1998 (remember whem you needed a boot *and* root floppy?). I spent years of my life on IRC helping other people and even meeting my wife. I graduated college cum laude and started making money with my hobby: php webdevelopment. Since I have a very broad field of interest, I also did some sysadmin tasks in most of my jobs. I'm very happy to live in this era with public cloud, infra as code and automation but still remember the days 720Kb floppy storage was all you'd had.
